## Season 2 Crafting Changes

### Key Updates

- **Spark of Ingenuity**: Earn one spark every two weeks, used for crafting high-level gear
- **Crest Requirements**: Reduced crest costs for crafting compared to Season 1
- **Crafting Season 1 Gear**: Can craft item level 629 gear without a Spark using Enchanted Crests
- **Crest Exchange**: Improved exchange rate of 45:1 (down from 90:1 in Season 1)

- **Crafting Materials**: New materials from Undermine and Season 2 content
- **Profession Knowledge**: Knowledge cap increased, with new specialization options
- **Crafting Orders**: System remains with some quality-of-life improvements

### Crafting Power Levels

| Crafting Combination | Item Level | Requirements |
|----------------------|------------|--------------|
| Season 1 Gear | 629 | Enchanted Crests (no Spark needed) |
| Runed Crests + Spark | 658 | 45 Runed Crests + 1 Spark of Ingenuity |
| Gilded Crests + Spark | 675 | 60 Gilded Crests + 1 Spark of Ingenuity |

### Material Changes

- **New Zone Materials**: Gathered from Undermine and its surrounding areas
- **Raid Materials**: New materials drop from Liberation of Undermine raid bosses
- **Mythic+ Materials**: Special reagents from Season 2 Mythic+ dungeons
- **Delve Materials**: Unique crafting materials from Tier 8+ Delves

## Optimal Crafting Strategy

### Early Season Approach

1. **Season 1 Gear Crafting**:
   - Trade Weathered Crests for Enchanted Crests at the vendor in Dornogal
   - Craft item level 629 gear without needing a Spark of Ingenuity
   - Focus on slots that won't be replaced by tier gear
   - Great for quickly gearing up alts or fresh characters

2. **First Spark Usage**:
   - Complete Story Mode Gwick (available after March 10th) to earn an Enchanted Runed Crest
   - Use this with your first Spark to craft an item level 658 piece
   - Prioritize weapons, rings, or neck pieces for maximum impact
   - These slots provide the biggest power increase and don't compete with tier gear

3. **Weathered Crest Farming**:
   - Farm Azeroth Orbs in zones with active World Soul Memories events
   - These provide a steady stream of Weathered Crests for crafting and upgrades
   - Convert excess Weathered Crests to higher-tier crests when possible

### Mid-Season Strategy

1. **Runed Crest Crafting**:
   - Earn Runed Crests from Mythic+ (level 2+) and Delves (Tier 8+)
   - 45 Runed Crests + Spark = Item level 658 gear
   - Target slots based on your current gear gaps
   - Consider recrafting if you need different secondary stats

2. **Gilded Crest Crafting**:
   - Earn Gilded Crests from Mythic+ (level 7+) and Delves (Tier 11)
   - 60 Gilded Crests + Spark = Item level 675 gear
   - Save for your most important slots (typically weapons or trinkets)
   - This represents the highest craftable item level in Season 2

3. **Crest Exchange System**:
   - Once your gear surpasses what a particular crest type can upgrade to, trade lower crests for higher ones
   - The exchange rate is now 45:1 (down from 90:1 in Season 1)
   - This allows you to convert excess Weathered Crests into Carved, then into Runed, and potentially into Gilded

## Spark of Fortunes System

### Obtaining Your First Spark

1. **Pick up the Spark Quest**:
   - Visit the Catalyst area to pick up the new Spark quest
   - In Season 2, these are called "Sparks of Fortunes"
   - They allow crafting gear up to item level 675

2. **Earn a Fractured Spark**:
   - Complete one of the weekly quests that rewards a Pinnacle Cache:
     - World Soul weekly quest
     - Titan Archive quest
     - Delve quest
   - The first Pinnacle Cache quest you complete will reward a Fractured Spark of Fortunes

3. **Complete the Spark Quest**:
   - Turn in the quest to receive a second Fractured Spark
   - Combine the two Fractured Sparks to create a complete Spark of Fortunes

4. **Ongoing Acquisition**:
   - You'll earn one Fractured Spark per week
   - This means you can craft one piece of Spark gear every two weeks

### Using Your Spark Effectively

1. **Crafting Considerations**:
   - Make sure your item is crafted at rank 5 for maximum item level
   - Check class guides on Wowhead for recommended items and embellishments
   - Consider waiting until you have two Sparks if you use two-handed weapons

2. **Timing Strategy**:
   - You may want to wait until later in the week or even a couple of weeks
   - This allows you to see what gear you get from other sources first
   - Craft for slots that are lagging behind in item level

3. **Upgrade Path**:
   - Complete the story campaign through defeating Gwick
   - This rewards an Enchanted Runed Undermine Crest
   - Use this to upgrade your Spark crafted gear to item level 658
   - If you can't defeat Gwick in Week 1, Story Mode opens in Week 2 for an easy completion

## Crafting Season 1 Gear (Catch-Up Mechanic)

### Process

1. **Gather Weathered Crests**:
   - Collect 30 Weathered Undermine Crests
   - Sources include world content, heroic dungeons, LFR boss kills, and early delve tiers

2. **Convert to Enchanted Crests**:
   - Visit the vendor next to the crafting order clerk in Dornogal
   - Trade 30 Weathered Crests for Enchanted Weathered Crests

3. **Craft Blue Gear**:
   - Use the Enchanted Crests when crafting blue gear
   - This allows the gear to reach item level 629
   - No Spark of Ingenuity needed for this process

4. **Customize Stats**:
   - Use missives to choose your preferred secondary stats
   - This makes the catch-up gear even more effective
   - Target your class's priority stats for best results

### Benefits

- Quick way to fill low item level slots
- Accessible to fresh characters or alts
- Customizable stats to match your needs
- Doesn't consume your valuable Sparks of Fortunes
- Can craft multiple pieces if you have enough Weathered Crests
