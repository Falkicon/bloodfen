# WoW Season 2: Delves & World Content Guide

## Introduction

Season 2 brings significant changes to Delves and introduces the new Undermine zone with exciting world content. This guide covers everything you need to know about solo/duo progression through Delves and maximizing your rewards from world activities.

## Delves in Season 2

### Key Changes from Season 1

- **All Tiers Matter**: Unlike Season 1 where only Tiers 1-8 were needed for gear (with 9-11 being "challenge only"), every tier in Season 2 is part of your progression path.

- **Rewards Table Shift**: 
  - Tier 6 now rewards Veteran 2/8 gear
  - Tier 8+ rewards Champion 2/8 gear
  - Tier 8 Great Vault slot rewards Hero 1/6 gear
  - Tiers 9-11 provide significantly more crests for upgrading gear

- **Delver's Bounty Improvements**:
  - No more RNG headaches
  - Guaranteed to get one within your first few Delves each week
  - Triggers as a reward based on the Delve you finish after using it
  - Allows you to target higher rewards by completing higher tier Delves
  - Using a Delver's Bounty on a Tier 8+ Delve guarantees a piece of Hero-track gear

- **New Treasure Chests**:
  - **Nemesis Strongbox**: Upgraded by defeating "Underling" enemy packs (up to 4 per run)
  - **Gilded Stash**: Available in Tier 11 Delves, can be looted 3 times per week for 7 Gilded Crests each time

- **Brann Bronzebeard Improvements**:
  - Keeps his level from Season 1
  - Level cap raised from 60 to 80
  - Can now be a tank, making Delves significantly easier

- **Curio Upgrade Simplification**:
  - Must obtain each rank in order (no skipping straight to rank 4)
  - Every curio upgrade item increases a curio by +1 rank regardless of the Delve tier
  - Using a Restored Coffer Key on a Bountiful Coffer guarantees a curio upgrade

### Getting Started with Delves

1. **Unlock Delves Season 2**:
   - Visit Delver's Headquarters in Dornogal for the intro quest
   - Complete "Delver's Journey" quest for the Gob-trotter mount
   - Get your first coffer key

2. **Understanding Progression**:
   - Your tier progression from Season 1 doesn't carry over to Season 2
   - To unlock a higher tier, complete a delve on the tier below it with some lives remaining
   - Each tier has its own recommended item level and rewards
   - Tiers 1-8 provide a gradual curve, while tiers 9-11 are the hardest

3. **Reward Structure**:
   - Tier 6: Veteran 2/8 gear from end chest
   - Tier 7+: Champion gear from Bountiful chests
   - Tier 8: Credits toward Hero gear from Great Vault
   - Tier 9+: Significant Runed Crest rewards
   - Tier 11: Gilded Crests for top-end gear upgrades

### Progression Strategy

#### Starting Out (Early Season)
1. Choose fast/easy delves to quickly progress through tiers
   - The Sinkhole in Hall of Fall is quick and easy
   - The new Side Street delve in Undermine is a good option
   - Tan Abys is also recommended
   - Avoid Bountiful delves until you reach Tier 8
2. If you struggle, try changing Brann's role (tank, healer, or DPS)
3. Complete Tier 7+ Delves for your Great Vault (rewards item level 649 Hero gear)
4. When you get a Delver's Bounty, push to Tier 8 to immediately get a piece of item level 649 gear
5. Use Weathered and Carved Crests to upgrade your initial gear
6. Only spend Coffer Keys on Tier 8+ Bountiful Delves to ensure Champion-track gear

#### Mid-Progression
1. Work up to Tier 9 Delves to earn Runed Crests
2. Use these to upgrade your gear and get stronger rewards from the Great Vault
3. Focus on killing Underling packs to maximize the Nemesis Strongbox rewards

#### End-Game
1. Push to Tier 11 Delves
2. Clear Bounty-filled Tier 11s for maximum Runed Crests
3. Loot the Gilded Stash 3 times weekly for 21 Gilded Crests total (7 per stash)
4. Use Gilded Crests to upgrade gear from Hero 3 to Hero 6
5. No catch-up system exists, so start clearing early!

### Weekly Mission Options

#### Option 1: Maximum Efficiency
- Complete 8 Tier 11 Delves
- This will:
  - Fill your Great Vault
  - Earn Gilded Crests
  - Allow you to spend your Delver's Bounty
  - Use your weekly Runed Coffer Keys
  - Get you as many Runed Crests as possible

#### Option 2: More Accessible Approach
- Complete 3 Bounty-filled Tier 11s for Gilded Crests (use Delver's Bounty on one of these)
- Complete 5 Tier 9s to fill the Great Vault and spend remaining Coffer Keys
- This gets you slightly fewer Runed Crests but still provides excellent progress

#### Option 3: Minimum Viable Approach
- Complete 8 Tier 7 Delves for Great Vault slots
- Use all your Coffer Keys on Tier 8+ Bountiful Delves
- Use your Delver's Bounty on a Tier 8 Delve for a guaranteed piece of Hero gear
- This approach is perfect for fresh characters or those with limited time

### Delver's Bounty Map System

- Delver's Bounty Maps are random drops from the end of your delves
- You can get one map per week with bad luck protection built in
- As long as you keep running delves, you will eventually get your map for the week
- When used, your next delve run will contain an extra treasure chest
- This chest can contain up to item level 649 gear if used on a Tier 8+ delve
- The rewards depend on the tier of delve you complete with the map active, not the tier it dropped on
- Don't use maps below Tier 8 if you want to maximize your rewards

### Wave Scrambler 2000

- Special item purchasable from the delve vendor for 2,000 under coins
- When used, summons the Underpin (the new ZVA for Season 2) to your delve
- If you get him down to 50% health, he drops a pile of loot and runs away
- The loot pile will always contain a Delver's Bounty Map if you haven't gotten one that week
- Can also include an item level 639 piece of gear
- You can only use it after reaching the checkpoint stone for the current delve
- Affordable in the first week if you run your Bountiful delves
- Great way to guarantee your map drop without grinding delves all day

### Tank Bran Bronzebeard

#### Benefits
- Takes the brunt of damage and debuffs
- Handles interrupts and dispels
- Deals decent damage as a tank
- Can keep you alive once well-leveled
- His revive timer acts as a safety net
- If he dies, you can run away and he'll snap back to your position after reviving

#### Weakness
- Lacks self-sustain, which creates challenges for DPS players

#### Tips for Working with Tank Bran
1. **Interrupt and CC**: Treat Bran like a fussy Mythic+ tank who needs your support
2. **Take it slow**: Bran struggles against large packs due to stacking DoTs
3. **Have an escape plan**: Know which direction to run and which defensive abilities to use
4. **Stay defensive**: Even with Bran tanking, be ready for AOE damage
5. **Use all your tools**: Bring your full toolkit, especially for bosses with enrage mechanics

#### Class-Specific Notes
- **Healers**: Tank Bran is amazing for healers
  - Bran's damage scales with healing received
  - Pumping single-target heals into Bran makes him nearly unkillable
  - Tier 11s become almost effortless with a well-healed Bran

- **Tanks**: If you're comfortable tanking, Bran is still good as DPS/healer
  - If struggling with higher tiers, consider letting Bran tank

### Best Curio Setup

#### For DPS with Tank Bran
- **Measor Easy Build Kit**
  - Zero effort but highly effective
  - Taunting measors take damage away from Bran
  - Prevents Bran's death, your biggest source of failure

#### For Healers
- **Pinged Augment Chip**
  - Huge boost to Bran's survivability and power
  - Requires you to dispel Bran when bombs run at him
  - Not recommended for DPS players (requires using damage on bombs)

#### Additional Slots
- **Three-Dimensional Bio Printer**
  - Very strong against elite creatures and bosses
  - Summons copies when needed
  - Safe and reliable choice

- **Pacifist Rig**
  - Allows you to pilot a mech
  - Gimmicky but fun and strong
  - Worth trying

- **For Speed Runs**
  - Biofuel Rocket Gear for low-level Delves
  - Provides stacking movement speed and haste buffs

## Weekly Routine Optimization

### Delves Weekly Checklist
- Complete at least one Tier 8+ Delve for Great Vault
- Use your Delver's Bounty on the highest tier possible
- Spend all Runed Coffer Keys on Tier 8+ Bountiful Delves
- Push to Tier 11 when ready for Gilded Crests
- Loot the Gilded Stash in Tier 11 three times

### World Content Checklist
- Kill The Gobfather world boss for guaranteed item level 642 gear
- Complete all Undermine world quests
- Participate in Shipping and Handling events
- Check for weekly quests that reward renown or gear
- Join Surge events when they appear

### Combined Approach
- **Monday**: Reset day - plan your week
- **Tuesday**: Kill world boss, start Delves progression
- **Wednesday-Thursday**: Push Delves to highest tier, do world quests
- **Friday-Sunday**: Complete remaining weekly activities, maximize renown gains

## Crest Exchange System

Season 2 features an improved crest exchange system:

- Once your character has no other use for a particular crest type (e.g., all gear is better than what Weathered Crests can upgrade to), you can trade them up
- Exchange rate is now 45:1 (down from 90:1 in Season 1)
- This allows you to convert excess Weathered Crests into Carved, then into Runed, and potentially into Gilded
- Significantly more efficient than in Season 1, making it worthwhile to farm lower-tier content

## Conclusion

Season 2's Delves and world content provide viable paths for gear and upgrades parallel to dungeons and raids. By understanding the changes to Delves and taking advantage of the new Undermine activities, you can efficiently progress your character even if you prefer solo or casual play.

Remember that consistency is key - doing your weekly Delves and world activities will steadily improve your character over time. With Tank Bran at your side and the riches of Undermine at your fingertips, you're well-equipped for success in Season 2.

Good luck in your adventures beneath Azeroth!
