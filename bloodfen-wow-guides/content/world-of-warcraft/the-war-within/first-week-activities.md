# WoW Season 2: First Week Activities & Checklist

## Introduction

Welcome to Season 2 of The War Within! This guide provides a comprehensive checklist and strategy for your first week in the new season. By following this plan, you'll efficiently kickstart your character's progression and set yourself up for success in the weeks to come.

## Pre-Launch Preparation

- Update all addons, especially WeakAuras, DBM/BigWigs, and Mythic Dungeon Tools
- Stock up on consumables (flasks, potions, food, augment runes)
- Clear bag space and bank slots for new gear
- Review class changes and talent builds for Season 2
- Join Discord communities for your class/spec to stay updated on meta shifts

## Catch-Up Mechanics and Quick Gearing Hacks

Before diving into the weekly activities, take advantage of these powerful catch-up mechanics to boost your item level quickly:

### 1. Story Quest Rewards
- Complete the new story quests to earn a full set of item level 597 gear
- Save your Valor Stones rather than upgrading this gear, as it will be replaced quickly

### 2. Auction House BOEs
- Purchase item level 603 BOE pieces from the auction house for a quick boost
- This is one of the fastest ways to gear up if you have the gold to spare

### 3. Crafted Season 1 Gear
- Trade Weathered Crests for Enchanted Crests at the vendor in Dornogal
- Use these to craft item level 629 gear without needing a Spark of Ingenuity
- If you haven't claimed your Season 1 Renown rewards, you can get approximately 120 Weathered Crests instantly
- This allows you to craft up to eight pieces of item level 629 gear immediately

### 4. Cersei Circlet
- Complete the Siren Isle questline to obtain this powerful item level 658 ring
- The questline is no longer time-gated and can be completed in one session

### 5. Story Mode Gwick
- Complete Story Mode Gwick (available after March 10th) to earn an Enchanted Runed Crest
- Use this with your first Spark of Ingenuity to craft an item level 658 piece
- Prioritize weapons, rings, or neck pieces for maximum impact

### 6. Weathered Crest Farming
- Farm Azeroth Orbs in zones with active World Soul Memories events
- These provide a steady stream of Weathered Crests for crafting and upgrades

## Day 1: Launch Day Priorities

### Maintenance Information
- US Realms will be down from 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. Pacific on launch day
- Great Vault will initially contain Season 1 rewards from the previous week
- Claim your vault reward before starting Season 2 content

### Immediate To-Do List
1. **Pick Up the Spark of Fortunes Quest**
   - Visit the Catalyst area to pick up the new Spark quest
   - You'll need to collect a Fractured Spark of Fortunes to complete it
   - This will allow you to craft gear up to item level 675 in Season 2

2. **Complete Weekly Quests for Caches**
   - "Urge to Surge" weekly quest in Undermine (pick up at the hotel hub)
   - Theater Troop event on the Isle of Dawn
   - "Awakening the Machine" event in the Ringing Deeps (now with less downtime)
   - "Spreading the Light" event in Hall of Fall
   - Weekly quests in Dornogal: World Soul weekly, Titan Archive, and Delve quests
   - These reward caches with item level 623 gear (upgradable to 645)
   - The first four caches you open will contain Restored Coffer Keys for Delves
   - The first Pinnacle Cache quest you complete will reward a Fractured Spark of Fortunes

3. **Complete Season 2 Intro Questlines**
   - Finish the Undermine questline in Dornogal
   - Pick up "Disposing of the Garbage" from the Incontinental Hotel for Operation: Floodgate dungeon
   - These quests reward useful gear and unlock seasonal features

4. **Unlock Delves Season 2**
   - Visit Delver's Headquarters in Dornogal for the intro quest
   - Complete "Delver's Journey" quest for the Gob-trotter mount
   - Get your first coffer key

5. **Begin Undermine Activities**
   - Participate in the "Shipping and Handling" public event (runs every hour at xx:30)
   - Complete delivery jobs for Weathered Crests and bonus rewards
   - Clear world quests for reputation with Cartels of Undermine

## Day 1-3: Gearing Focus

### World Boss
- Kill the new world boss in Undermine (The Gobfather)
- You are guaranteed a piece of item level 642 Warbound gear on your first kill per week for your account
- This gear can be traded to any of your characters
- This is a significant upgrade from previous seasons where drops were RNG-based

### Dungeon Strategy
1. **Clear All Mythic 0 Dungeons**
   - Each boss now drops Champion-track gear (item level 637)
   - Prioritize the new dungeon "Operation: Floodgate" (4 bosses)
   - Coordinate with friends or use group finder to run each available dungeon once

2. **Begin Mythic+ Progression**
   - Start with lower keys (+2 to +5) to get comfortable with the new affix system
   - No affixes until key level 4, making it easier to learn the dungeons
   - Push to at least one +6 key for Hero-track gear (item level 649) from the end-of-run chest
   - If possible, complete one +7 or higher for Gilded Crests and better vault rewards
   - M+ dungeons have reduced scaling in Season 2 (7% per level instead of 10% for keys 2-10)
   - +2 keys now drop Runed Crests, making it easier to farm upgrade materials

### Delves Progression
1. **Initial Delves Strategy**
   - Your tier progression from Season 1 doesn't carry over
   - To unlock a higher tier, complete a delve on the tier below with lives remaining
   - Choose fast/easy delves to quickly progress (Sinkhole in Hall of Fall, Side Street in Undermine, or Tan Abys)
   - Avoid Bountiful delves until you reach Tier 8
   - If you struggle, try changing Brann's role (tank, healer, or DPS)
   - Reach Tier 7+ for Champion gear from Bountiful chests
   - Use Coffer Keys only on Tier 8+ Bountiful Delves
   - Push to Tier 8 for Great Vault credit (rewards item level 649 Hero gear)

2. **When You Get Delver's Bounty**
   - Delver's Bounty Maps are random drops from the end of delves (one per week with bad luck protection)
   - When used, your next delve run will contain an extra treasure chest
   - Use it on a Tier 8+ Delve for item level 649 gear
   - Consider purchasing the Wave Scrambler 2000 from the delve vendor (2,000 under coins)
   - This summons the Underpin (Season 2 ZVA) who drops a Delver's Bounty Map and possibly gear

### PvP Initial Steps
1. **Honor Gear Acquisition**
   - Farm Honor in random battlegrounds, brawls, or skirmishes
   - Purchase Honor gear (scales to ilvl 665 in PvP combat)
   - Take advantage of the Battleground bonus event active in Week 1

2. **Conquest Points**
   - Begin earning Conquest toward the weekly cap
   - Consider crafting PvP pieces with Prized Gladiator's Heraldry
   - Complete the "Arena Skirmish wins" or "Rated wins" weekly quests

### Crafting Priorities
1. **Use Your Week 1 Crafting Spark Wisely**
   - Combine your two Fractured Sparks to create a Spark of Fortunes
   - Consider saving it for Week 2 when you have more options and materials
   - If using immediately, prioritize a weapon or trinket for maximum impact
   - For casters/healers, an alchemy stone or inscription idol is a good option
   - Make sure your item is crafted at rank 5

2. **Crafted Catch-Up Gear**
   - If your gear is lacking, craft item level 629 gear using Enchanted Weathered Crests
   - Turn 30 Weathered Crests into one piece of 629 gear at the vendor next to the crafting order clerk
   - Use missives to choose your best stats
   - This is an excellent way to fill low item level slots quickly

3. **Profession Development**
   - Complete profession weekly quests
   - Gather knowledge to unlock new recipes
   - Check Undermine renown vendors for profession recipes

## Day 4-7: Optimization & Weekly Completion

### Complete the Story Campaign
- Finish the main story campaign that became available with Season 2
- The final quest asks you to defeat Gwick in the raid
- This rewards an Enchanted Runed Undermine Crest (upgrades spark crafted gear to item level 658)
- Completing the story also unlocks the Undermine campaign skip for your account
- If you can't defeat Gwick this week, Story Mode opens next week for an easy completion

### Great Vault Progress
- Complete at least one keystone at the highest level you can manage
- Aim for 8 Mythic+ dungeons to unlock all three M+ choices
- Complete at least 8 Tier 7+ Delves for Hero-track gear from the Great Vault
- If you enjoy PvP, get some rated arena or battleground wins for a PvP item choice

### Raid Preparation
- The first two bosses in LFR are available in Week 1
- Both are tier set bosses with interesting loot options
- If lucky, you could get a 2-set bonus just from these two bosses
- More LFR bosses become available each week
- Killing bosses in LFR contributes to your raid Renown track

### Reputation Focus
- Prioritize Cartels of Undermine reputation
- Check renown vendors at Cartel bases for gear tokens and recipes
- Aim for Renown 4+ with Gallagio Loyalty Rewards Club for raid buffs

### End of Week Checklist
- Ensure you've completed all weekly quests
- Cap your Conquest points if possible
- Use any remaining Coffer Keys in Tier 8+ Delves
- Check your progress toward the 1600 M+ rating milestone for the Crystallized Kaja'mite Essence
