## Loot & Item Levels

Loot in Liberation of Undermine scales up with later bosses:

|---------------|-----|--------|--------|--------|
| Bosses 1-4    | 626 | 639    | 652    | 665    |
| Bosses 5-8    | 633 | 645    | 658    | 671    |

**Very Rare Drops**: Bosses 5 and onward have special "Very Rare" loot drops that are +7 item levels above their normal drops (e.g., 652 instead of 645 on Normal).

## Tier Set Acquisition

### Tier Set Tokens

Tier set tokens drop from specific bosses:
- **Head**: The One-Armed Bandit (Boss 5)
- **Shoulders**: Rick Reverb (Boss 3)
- **Chest**: Sprocketmonger (Boss 4)
- **Hands**: The Cauldron of Carnage (Boss 2)
- **Legs**: Mug'Zee (Boss 6)
- **Omni-token**: Chrome King Gallywix (Boss 8) - Can be used by any class

### LFR Tier Acquisition

- The first two bosses available in LFR (Week 1) are both tier token bosses:
  - The Cauldron of Carnage (hands)
  - Rick Reverb (shoulders)
- This means you can potentially get a 2-piece tier set bonus just from LFR in the first week
- Additional tier bosses become available in subsequent weeks
- LFR is a viable path for collecting tier pieces, especially for players who don't raid at higher difficulties

### Catalyst System

The Catalyst system returns in Season 2 with some changes:

- **Availability**: The Catalyst becomes available a few weeks into the season
- **Charge Acquisition**: 
  - One charge every two weeks
  - Additional charge from completing Story Mode Gwick (available after March 10th)
  - Additional charge from achieving Keystone Master, Ahead of the Curve, or 1600 PvP rating (now adds a charge rather than providing a tier token)
- **Usage**: Transform non-tier pieces into tier pieces of the same slot
- **Strategy**: Save charges for slots you're having bad luck with from raid drops

### Great Vault

- Fill raid slots in your Great Vault for additional chances at tier pieces
- Combine with M+ and PvP slots to maximize your options
- Prioritize selecting tier pieces when available in your vault

## Raid Progression Strategy

### Preparation
1. **Gear Requirements**:
   - Aim for item level 606+ before entering
   - Enchant and gem all gear
   - Stock up on flasks, potions, food, and augment runes

2. **Consumables**:
   - Use the new Undermine augment rune (+str/agi/int)
   - Bring health potions or healthstones
   - Have cooked food for heal-over-time effects

### First Week Strategy
1. **Difficulty Choice**:
   - Run Story Mode once for lore and a free Crystallized Essence of Kaja'mite
   - Focus on Normal mode to learn mechanics
   - Progress to Heroic if your group is prepared
   - Consider running LFR for additional chances at tier pieces from the first two bosses

2. **Boss Priority**:
   - Clear all three available bosses
   - Focus on bosses that drop your tier tokens
   - Consider running Raid Finder for additional chances at tier pieces

### Full Raid Strategy
1. **Renown Benefits**:
   - Farm Gallagio Loyalty Rewards Club renown
   - At Renown 5: Unlock a skip to near the end-boss after killing the first boss
   - At Renown 4+ (and every few levels): Gain stacking +3% damage/healing buff in the raid (up to +18% at Renown 19)

2. **Loot Distribution**:
   - Group Loot is the only loot mode (Personal Loot is gone)
   - Trading restrictions have been lifted - you can trade any loot even if it's an upgrade
   - Consider funneling rare drops to key players
   - Prioritize completing 2-piece and 4-piece tier sets

## Raid Buffs & Advantages

### Renown Buffs
- Starting at Renown 4 with Gallagio Loyalty Rewards Club: +3% damage/healing
- Every few renown levels: Additional +3% (up to +18% at Renown 19)
- These act as a soft nerf over time, making bosses easier as you gain renown

### Raid Skip
- At Renown 5: Unlock a skip that lets you jump to near Mug'Zee and Chrome King Gallywix
- Useful for targeting specific loot or focusing on end bosses after initial clears

### Catalyst Bonus
- Complete Story Mode for a free Crystallized Essence of Kaja'mite
- Grants an extra Catalyst charge when the Catalyst becomes available
- Use this to convert a piece of gear to tier if you're unlucky with drops

### Raid Renown Track

- Killing bosses in any difficulty (including LFR) contributes to your raid Renown track
- You don't need to do the raid on higher difficulties to earn all rewards
- Bonuses in the track make the raid easier as you progress
- The more you do the raid, even on LFR, the easier it becomes
- Track also includes cosmetic and collectible rewards

## Raid Composition Tips

### Tank Considerations
- Blood DK and Brewmaster Monk are performing well early in Season 2
- Prot Paladin and Vengeance DH are also in a good spot
- Bring tanks with strong cooldown rotations for heavy damage phases

### Healer Setup
- Preservation Evoker and Resto Druid show strong healing throughput
- Restoration Shaman received a +4% healing buff in recent tuning
- Consider healer diversity for various utility (e.g., Shaman for Spirit Link)

### DPS Recommendations
- S-tier performers: Elemental/Enhancement Shaman, Fire Mage
- Strong A-tier options: Feral/Balance Druid, Shadow Priest, Frost DK, Subtlety/Assassination Rogue, Retribution Paladin, Beast Mastery Hunter, Warlock (Destro/Afflic)
- Coordinate cooldowns for key burn phases
- Bring utility for interrupts and crowd control

## Addons & WeakAuras

- Update your raid addons before entering
- Look for Liberation of Undermine WeakAura packs that call out mechanics
- Particularly useful for visual chaos in goblin fights (e.g., "Dodge sawblades now!")
- DBM/BigWigs timers will help track boss abilities

## Story Mode Gwick Quest

- The final quest in the Season 2 story campaign asks you to defeat Gwick in the raid
- Completing this quest rewards an Enchanted Runed Undermine Crest
- This crest can be used to upgrade your spark crafted gear to item level 658
- If you can't defeat Gwick in the first week, don't worry
- Story Mode opens in Week 2, providing an easy way to complete this quest
- Story Mode is essentially a free kill on Gwick specifically for quest progression

## Conclusion

Liberation of Undermine offers a chaotic and exciting raid experience with unique goblin-themed encounters. By understanding the boss mechanics, leveraging the renown system, and coordinating your raid team effectively, you'll be well-positioned to conquer Chrome King Gallywix and claim your rewards.

Remember that knowledge of mechanics often trumps raw gear power - spend time learning the fights, and you'll progress more efficiently than groups relying solely on outgearing the content.

Good luck in your liberation efforts!
