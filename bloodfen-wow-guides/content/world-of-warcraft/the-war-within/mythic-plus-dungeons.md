# WoW Season 2: Mythic+ Dungeon Guide

## Introduction

Season 2 brings substantial updates to the Mythic+ system, with a revamped dungeon rotation, smoother difficulty scaling, and a restructured affix system. This guide covers everything you need to know to succeed in Mythic+ during The War Within Season 2.

## Dungeon Rotation

Season 2 features a mix of current expansion dungeons and returning favorites:

### The War Within Dungeons (5)
- **Operation: Floodgate** (NEW) - Goblin Waterworks themed dungeon
- **Cinderbrew Meadery** - Dwarven brewery with fire and alcohol mechanics
- **The Rookery** - Dracthyr hatching grounds with aerial mechanics
- **Darkflame Cleft** - Volcanic caverns with shadow and fire elements

### Returning Dungeons (3)
- **The Motherlode** (Battle for Azeroth) - Goblin mining operation

## Mythic+ System Changes

### Difficulty Scaling
- Key levels 2-10: Mob health/damage increases by only +7% per level (down from 10%)
- Key levels 11+: Scaling returns to 10% per level
- This makes the climb through mid-level keys significantly easier

### Affix System Overhaul
- **Mythic+1 to +3**: No affixes (clean dungeons for learning)
- **Mythic+4**: First affix appears - One of the new **Xal'atath's Bargain** rotating affixes
- **Mythic+7**: **Tyrannical/Fortified** affix added (alternating weekly)
  - Tyrannical: Bosses have 30% more health and deal 15% increased damage
  - Fortified: Non-boss enemies have 20% more health and deal 15% increased damage
- **Mythic+10**: Second **Xal'atath's Bargain** rotating affix added (whichever wasn't active at +4)
- **Mythic+12**: **Xal'atath's Guile** affix added - Reintroduces a death timer penalty

### Reward Structure
- **Mythic 0**: Drops Champion-track gear (item level 637) from each boss
- **Mythic+2**: Provides Hero-track gear in the Great Vault
- **Mythic+6 and higher**: End-of-run chests drop Hero-track gear (item level 649)
- **Mythic+7 and higher**: Gilded Crests drop (previously required +11)
- **Mythic+10 and higher**: Great Vault rewards Mythic raid-level gear
- **Great Vault**:
  - Mythic+2: Rewards Hero 1 gear (item level 641)
  - Mythic+7: Rewards Hero 4 gear (item level 647)
  - Mythic+10: Rewards Mythic raid-level gear (item level 650)
  - Higher keys provide even better vault options
