## PvP Gearing Strategy

### Early Season Approach

1. **Honor Gear Foundation**:
   - Farm random battlegrounds, epic battlegrounds, and skirmishes
   - Complete weekly PvP quests for bonus honor
   - Focus on upgrading weapon and trinkets first
   - Honor gear reaches item level 637 when fully upgraded

2. **Conquest Acquisition**:
   - Weekly conquest cap starts at 550 and increases by 550 each week
   - First win of the day in each rated bracket awards bonus conquest
   - Solo Shuffle provides consistent conquest for solo players
   - Rated Battlegrounds offer the highest conquest per hour when winning

3. **Upgrade Priority**:
   - Weapon (highest damage increase)
   - Trinkets (PvP trinket set bonus is crucial)
   - Highest stat pieces (chest, legs, head)
   - Remaining armor pieces
   - Optimize for versatility as your primary secondary stat

### Efficient Honor Farming

1. **Best Honor Sources**:
   - Epic Battlegrounds: 1,500-2,000 honor per win
   - Regular Battlegrounds: 800-1,200 honor per win

2. **Honor Bonus Events**:
   - Battleground Bonus Event: +50% honor from battlegrounds
   - Arena Skirmish Bonus Event: +50% honor from skirmishes
   - Weekly event quests provide additional rewards

3. **Honor Conversion**:

   - Use Marks of Honor for transmog, toys, and mounts
   - Consider saving some honor for future conquest gear upgrades

### Conquest Strategy

1. **Weekly Cap Management**:
   - Prioritize hitting the weekly conquest cap
   - Cap increases by 550 each week (Week 1: 550, Week 2: 1100, etc.)
   - Catch-up mechanics allow newer players to earn conquest faster

2. **Rating Breakpoints**:
   - Push rating to unlock higher item level upgrades
   - Key breakpoints: 1000, 1400, 1800, and 2100
   - Each rating tier unlocks a new upgrade level for all conquest gear

3. **Great Vault Optimization**:
   - Complete 1/3/10 rated activities for maximum Great Vault options
   - Higher rating = higher item level rewards
   - Elite (2100+) rating rewards the highest item level gear (672)

## PvP Trinket Set Bonus
