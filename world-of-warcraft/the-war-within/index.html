doing the these events is still
1:31
worthwhile The Awakening the machine
1:33
event was actually updated and you can
1:35
now have less downtime if you opt for a
1:37
challenge so that event is much faster
1:39
to complete we also have the weekly
1:41
quests in dagal that reward you with a
1:44
pinnacle Cash There&rsquo;s the world Soul
1:45
weekly Quest the Titan archive Quest and
1:48
the delve Quest all three of these seem
1:50
to be available at the same time and
1:52
they each reward you with a pinnacle
1:53
cash the first one you complete will
1:56
also reward you with a fractured spark
1:58
of Fortunes I haven&rsquo;t seen them come
2:00
from any of the other weekly quests yet
2:02
so you&rsquo;ll need to complete at least one
2:03
of these Pinnacle cash weekly quests to
2:06
get your crafting sparks then there is
2:08
also a special assignment World quest in
2:10
undermine that rewards you with a cash
2:12
with the same rewards you need to do a
2:14
few World quests to unlock it first but
2:16
that shouldn&rsquo;t take too long now the
2:18
first two caches that you earn will
2:20
contain item level 623 pieces of gear
2:22
which will be a good upgrade for anyone
2:24
who didn&rsquo;t do endgame group content like
2:26
Mythic plus dungeons or raids during
2:28
season 1 that gear can upgraded up to
2:30
item level 645 using your Valor stones
2:33
and crests which should be a good
2:34
upgrade for pretty much every player in
2:37
this first week so those weekly caches
2:39
are a good quick source for early gear
2:41
upgrades the first four caches that you
2:43
open will contain restored Coffer Keys
2:46
these keys are needed to get the best
2:47
rewards out of the delve system so
2:50
everyone will want to get four of these
2:51
weekly caches every week if you plan on
2:54
gearing up through delves and then any
2:56
caches that you get after that will
2:58
still reward you with Valor stones and
2:59
carved crests so they&rsquo;re still worth
3:01
doing even if they don&rsquo;t reward you with
3:03
any more gear or Coffer Keys as long as
3:06
you do the world Soul weekly Quest or
3:08
one of the weekly quests that rewards a
3:09
pinnacle cash you should be able to hand
3:11
in that spark Quest get your free
3:14
fractured Spark from it combine the two
3:16
together and you&rsquo;ll have your first
3:17
Spark of Fortunes you can then use that
3:20
spark to get some item level 645 gear
3:22
crafted right away just make sure your
3:24
item is crafted at rank five which item
3:27
you craft is going to be up to you I
3:29
would check your class guide on Wowhead
3:31
to see what items they recommend
3:33
crafting first and which embellishments
3:35
to use it may be a good idea to wait
3:37
until you have two whole Sparks if you
3:39
use two-handed weapons or just waiting
3:41
until you&rsquo;ve done a bit of gearing up in
3:42
season 2 so crafting your item towards
3:45
the back end of this week or holding on
3:47
to your spark for a couple of weeks
3:49
could be beneficial it just depends on
3:51
how quickly you want to benefit from
3:53
that piece of spark crafted gear we
3:55
should get another fractured spark every
3:58
week so looking at one piece of spark
4:00
craftter gear every 2 weeks from this
4:02
point onwards this is a great time to
4:05
pop by the new world boss in undermine
4:07
and kill it for a chance at some useful
4:09
loot the way this world boss rewards
4:11
gear will be different from previous
4:12
patches or Seasons you are guaranteed a
4:15
piece of item level 642 warbound gear on
4:18
your first kill per week for your
4:20
account so you can trade this gear to
4:22
any of your characters but you&rsquo;re not
4:24
guaranteed to get something your current
4:26
class can use so you will get a piece of
4:29
gear every single s Le week when it&rsquo;s
4:30
only once per account and it might be an
4:32
upgrade for an ALT instead of your main
4:35
if you play multiple characters this
4:37
should be great but if you don&rsquo;t this
4:39
could get really frustrating but it is
4:41
still a chance for a big early upgrade
4:43
and it doesn&rsquo;t take very long at all you
4:46
will also want to complete the rest of
4:47
the main story campaign that became
4:49
available with the start of season 2
4:51
there aren&rsquo;t any huge gear rewards from
4:53
most of the chapters but the very last
4:55
quest in the storyline asks you to head
4:57
into the raid and defeat gwick that
4:59
Quest will reward you with an enchanted
5:01
runed undermine Crest which can be used
5:03
to upgrade your spark crafted gear up to
5:05
item level 658 so if you&rsquo;re able to take
5:08
down gwick anytime soon that&rsquo;s a huge
5:10
free upgrade for your spark crafted gear
5:13
completing the story Quest also unlocks
5:15
the undermine campaign skip for your
5:17
account so you&rsquo;ll also be able to skip
5:19
over the whole thing and get straight
5:20
into the seasonal content without you
5:22
having to work through all those story
5:24
quests yet again if you&rsquo;re worried about
5:26
not being able to take down gwick this
5:28
week don&rsquo;t worry too much next week the
5:30
story mode opens up for the raid which
5:32
is basically a free kill on gwick to
5:35
progress this Quest specifically so you
5:37
only have to wait until next week at the
5:39
very latest to get this Quest completed
5:42
from here you&rsquo;re going to want to look
5:43
at the new gearing options and seasonal
5:46
content that became available this week
5:48
you can jump into delves Mythic plus
5:50
dungeons or the new raid depending on
5:52
whether you want to take part in group
5:53
content or not but before we jump into
5:56
seasonal content if your gear is a
5:58
little bit lacking Maybe maybe you
5:59
didn&rsquo;t play too much in season 1 or you
6:02
just didn&rsquo;t get very far you can pick up
6:04
some item level 629 gear very easily to
6:07
Kickstart your adventure all you need
6:09
are weathered undermine crests you can
6:11
turn 30 crests into one piece of 629
6:14
gear by buying Enchanted weathered
6:16
crests at this vendor next to the
6:18
crafting order clerk then use those
6:20
Enchanted crests when crafting blue gear
6:23
and it can go up to item level 629 this
6:25
is super easy if you have the
6:27
professions yourself but if you don&rsquo;t
6:29
just set up a crafting order for blue
6:30
gear and pop the enchanted Crest in you
6:33
can also choose the stats on this gear
6:35
by using a missive so make sure you pick
6:37
your best stats to make this gear even
6:38
better sadly the flying orbs seem to
6:41
have been nerfed and no longer reward
6:43
weathered crests hopefully this changes
6:45
back but until then you can still do
6:47
World content like price surge events
6:49
heroic dungeons drop weather crests as
6:51
well LFR boss kills drop weather crests
6:54
and then early delve tiers drop them as
6:56
well so you&rsquo;re going to get quite a few
6:58
of these if you&rsquo;re playing the game G
7:00
just remember that you can turn 30
7:01
crests into another piece of gear if
7:03
you&rsquo;re still struggling to fill in some
7:05
of your lower item level slots with
7:07
those quick easy sources of gear squared
7:09
away it&rsquo;s time to hop into delves you
7:12
want to talk to bran and dagal to get
7:13
the seasonal Quest started find out what
7:16
happened to his hat and then grab your
7:18
seasonal delve Mount the delver&rsquo;s Gob
7:20
Trotter we&rsquo;ll be earning all kinds of
7:22
customizations for this one as should
7:24
progress through your seasonal Journey
7:26
now your tier progression from season 1
7:28
doesn&rsquo;t carry over into season 2 so
7:30
we&rsquo;ll need to unlock all of our tiers
7:32
again starting from tier four to unlock
7:34
a higher tier you need to complete a
7:36
delve on the tier below it with some
7:38
lives remaining you can do whatever
7:40
delves you want on the highest available
7:42
tier and just progress naturally but the
7:44
fastest way to climb through the delve
7:46
tiers is to choose a super fast or easy
7:48
delve and repeat that delve until you
7:50
reach the desired tier the sinkhole in
7:52
hallall is pretty quick and easy most of
7:54
the time the new side street slle delve
7:57
in undermine seems like a good option
7:58
too and tan abys is a good one as well
8:02
you mainly just want to avoid doing
8:03
Bountiful delves until you have tier
8:05
eight unlocked honestly any delve that
8:08
you find quick and easy will do just
8:10
fine and you can repeat the same delve
8:11
over and over again and just increase
8:13
the tier or difficulty as you unlock
8:15
them and you&rsquo;re going to be tier eight
8:17
in no time if you start to struggle at
8:19
all don&rsquo;t forget to play around with
8:21
Brown&rsquo;s roles he might serve you better
8:23
as DPS heals or tank so if you hit a
8:26
wall try a different role and see if
8:27
that helps you&rsquo;ll also be collect new
8:29
curios along the way so try out
8:31
different curios as well Bountiful
8:34
delves have a special chest at the end
8:36
of them which requires one of those
8:37
restored Coffer keys that we picked up
8:39
earlier to open these locked chests
8:42
contain much better rewards especially
8:44
gear rewards and they cap out at item
8:46
level 639 which comes from tier eight
8:48
Bountiful delves or above our restored
8:51
Cofer keys are strictly limited so
8:53
ideally you don&rsquo;t want to use any of
8:55
your restored Coffer keys until you get
8:57
to tier eight complete in tier eight
9:00
delves will also max out your delve
9:02
reward Row in the weekly Vault giving
9:03
you some item level 649 rewards after
9:06
the weekly reset so you&rsquo;ll want to get
9:08
at least two tier eight delves done to
9:10
ensure you have a good reward waiting
9:11
for you on Tuesday season 2 is a little
9:14
different from season one in that tiers
9:16
9 10 and 11 do offer better Crest
9:19
rewards this time so if you want to
9:20
maximize your crests from delves you&rsquo;ll
9:22
need to keep pushing and unlock those
9:24
higher tiers of delves as well though
9:26
that might be a bit Out Of Reach until
9:28
you get some good gear upgrades under
9:29
your belt tier 11 Bountiful Dells will
9:32
reward seven gilded crests three times
9:34
per week so if you can get up to that
9:36
point this week you&rsquo;ll get 21 gilded
9:38
crests to work with it&rsquo;s important to
9:40
note that you do not need Coffer keys to
9:43
get these gilded crests so don&rsquo;t feel
9:45
like you have to save any keys after you
9:47
get to tier eight delves another huge
9:49
part of Del rewards are tied to the
9:51
delvas Bounty Maps these are random drop
9:53
from the end of your delves you can get
9:55
one map per week and there is bad luck
9:57
protection built in here so as long as
9:59
you keep running delves you will
10:00
eventually get your map for the week
10:02
when used your next delve run will
10:04
contain an extra treasure chest with up
10:06
to item level 649 gear if used on a tier
10:09
8 delve so don&rsquo;t use maps below tier
10:12
eight if you want to maximize your
10:13
rewards the rewards from this map depend
10:16
on the tier of Del you complete with the
10:18
map active not the tier that the map
10:20
dropped on at least that&rsquo;s what the item
10:22
in game says so you don&rsquo;t have to worry
10:24
about getting a map early or anything
10:26
like that just don&rsquo;t use your map until
10:28
you can complete a ti8 delve or above
10:31
now there is a special item that you can
10:33
pick up called The Wave Scrambler 2000
10:35
which can be purchased from the delve
10:37
vendor for 2,000 under coins this item
10:40
will summon the underpin to your delve
10:42
who is the new zva for season 2 and if
10:44
you can get him down to 50% Health he
10:46
drops a big pile of Loot and runs away
10:49
he&rsquo;s supposed to drop this pile even if
10:51
you die and he runs away as well so you
10:52
don&rsquo;t have to fight him if you don&rsquo;t
10:54
want to but the main point is that pile
10:56
of loot will always contain a delver&rsquo;s
10:59
boun map if you haven&rsquo;t gotten one
11:00
already that week and it can also
11:02
include an item level 639 piece of gear
11:05
so that&rsquo;s one way to get an extra piece
11:06
of Loot and guarantee your map drop so
11:08
you don&rsquo;t have to grind delves all day
11:11
every day you should be able to afford
11:13
this item in the first week as long as
11:14
you run your Bountiful delves and you
11:16
can only use it after you&rsquo;ve reached the
11:18
checkpoint stone for the current delve
11:20
so as soon as you have 2,000 under coins
11:22
I would definitely go pick this up and
11:25
remember that delves can be done solo
11:27
but you can also do them in a group if
11:29
you prefer or if you just start to
11:31
struggle by yourself there are usually a
11:33
lot of groups setting up for delves and
11:35
everyone will be in the same boat right
11:37
now so don&rsquo;t be scared of jumping into
11:39
the group finder if you want some
11:40
company while you delve now if you would
11:42
prefer to jump into dungeons that&rsquo;s
11:44
perfectly fine as well remember that
11:47
Mythic zero dungeons will be more
11:48
rewarding in season 2 so that&rsquo;s a
11:50
perfect place to start your
11:51
dungeoneering adventures Mythic zero
11:54
bosses now drop item level 636 gear
11:56
which is one of a champion giving it
11:58
some huge huge upgrade potential doing
12:00
Mythic zero Dungeons and getting some
12:02
Valor stones and crests is a viable way
12:04
to gear up early on it&rsquo;s also worth
12:06
noting that jumping into the Mythic plus
12:08
Keystone system should be much easier in
12:10
season 2 as well the dungeons themselves
12:13
have received a lot of changes and nervs
12:15
the damage and health scaling as you
12:17
increase your key level will be lower in
12:19
season 2 when compared to season 1 so
12:21
dungeons will just be easier as you work
12:23
your way up the key levels and then you
12:25
also won&rsquo;t even have any axes until key
12:28
level four giving a chance to just get
12:30
used to the Dungeons and the timer
12:31
without any other weird additions for
12:33
you to think about plus two keys now
12:35
also drop runed crests right away so
12:38
farming runed crests to upgrade your
12:40
gear will be so much easier this season
12:42
as well you can run Mythic plus dungeons
12:45
as often as you want so they&rsquo;re a great
12:46
source of gear if you&rsquo;ve done all of the
12:48
dungeons on Mythic zero for the week or
12:50
if you just fancy pushing your keys and
12:51
getting better loot there are no limits
12:53
on Mythic plus Keystone loot even in the
12:55
first week of the season so you can go
12:57
all the way up to plus 10 keys get item
12:59
level 655 gear from every dungeon run
13:03
you can also pop into the new raid to
13:05
grab yourself some shiny gear the higher
13:07
the difficulty you do the better the
13:08
loot is going to be but even if you
13:10
don&rsquo;t have a group or a guild to run the
13:12
higher difficulties with the looking for
13:14
raid option opened up this week as well
13:16
the first two bosses are available and
13:18
they&rsquo;re both actually tier set bosses
13:20
too with some other interesting loot
13:22
options as well so hopping into LFR
13:24
could be worth your time if you get
13:26
lucky you could get two set bonus just
13:28
from those two bosses more LFR bosses
13:31
become available every week until the
13:33
entire raid is open so as the weeks go
13:35
by you&rsquo;ll be able to pick up more Tier
13:37
gear more Trinkets and more special raid
13:39
loot killing bosses in LFR will also
13:42
contribute to your raid Renown track so
13:44
you don&rsquo;t have to do the raid on higher
13:45
difficulties to earn all of these
13:47
rewards there are bonuses in here that
13:49
make the raid easier so the more you do
13:51
the raid even on LFR the easier it&rsquo;s
13:54
going to become and there are plenty of
13:55
cosmetic and collectible rewards to pick
13:57
up as well that&rsquo;s pretty much all the
14:00
big new stuff in the order I would
14:02
encourage you to check things out at
14:04
this point it&rsquo;s just down to what you
14:06
have fun with if you&rsquo;re more of a solo
14:08
player Master the delves and unlock all
14:10
the tiers to max out your rewards you
14:12
can go really far with just delves this
14:14
season dungeons are shipping up to be a
14:16
lot of fun as well and the seasonal
14:18
changes made things much easier so even
14:20
if you&rsquo;re not typically a dungeon person
14:22
I would poke your toes in to see if you
14:24
can find some fun there this season The
14:27
Raid is the least changed in in terms of
14:29
fun or exciting new stuff The Raid
14:31
Renown track is cool but it only really
14:33
helps you inside of the raid there are
14:35
some very powerful special items in the
14:37
raid though and of course getting your T
14:39
set gear earlier is always nice so there
14:42
are rewards worth chasing after in the
14:44
raid but delves and dungeons saw the
14:46
most changes in season 2 so I would
14:48
maybe Focus your efforts there to start
14:50
with but that&rsquo;s what to do first in the
14:52
season 2 of War within so that&rsquo;s it for
14:54
this video what content are you going to
14:56
be focusing on first getting your tier
14:59
eight delves unlocked to maximize those
15:01
Rewards or jumping into other group
